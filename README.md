Currently will save output frames in an output folder when run, be careful this makes alot of PNGs and can take up alot of space. 
Makes some interesting pictures, especially when you make the z value really small (0.001).
In the future it might be nice to try optimize this so it runs better in real time when there is lots of circles being drawn.
